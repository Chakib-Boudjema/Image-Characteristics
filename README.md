# Image-Characteristics
this repo is about how to calculate some image features
## Explanation
The characteristics of a shape are parameters that are used to represent the contained objects in the image quantitatively or qualitatively
## Features
### Area
is given by the number of white pixels belonging to the shape.
### Perimeter
is the number of white pixels that make up the outline of the shape.
### Compacity
it represents a measure allowing the distinction between a form irregular and a normal shape,the closer its value is to 1, the more irregular the shape is.
### Circularity
it represents the similarity between the shape and the circle, the closer its value is to 1, the more the shape looks like a circle.
### Eccentricity
is the degree of correspondence between the shape and is the smallest ellipse that surrounds the form.
### Rectangularity
is the degree of correspondence between a given shape and the rectangle that encompasses the form
